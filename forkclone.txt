A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two. You can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.



Git Fork is a personal copy of repository that lives on current user account (server side) whereas Git Clone is a copy of a repository that lives on an user computer (local machine) instead of on a website's server or anywhere else. Forks allow a user to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original and allow to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with the changes made. Git Clone is pretty much similar in the context that once a 'local copy' i.e. 'clone' is created, one can edit the files without being online and push them if s/he wants to. So the basic difference is the first one is a copy in the server and the latter is a copy in the local machine.
